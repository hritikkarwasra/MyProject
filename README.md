# MyProject
Various django views with their minimal frontend

To run use followong commands:

python3 -m venv venv
source venev/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver


Also to stay away from bugs i would recommend to delete all migrations after clonning and do 
python manage.py makemigrations --> python manage.py. migrate
